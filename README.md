# IC-design-tool
I'm currently working on a new way that is different than the drag and drop method for designing a circuit.

For drawing the circuit I will be using the turtle library
Check the provided link for documentation : https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html

How it will work ?
It's simple, I want to make a command window and drawing window, The drawing window will draw the commands that you will write, so for example if you wrote "R" it will draw a resistor.

Typing C will tell it to draw a capacitor.

And that's a demo RC circuit
